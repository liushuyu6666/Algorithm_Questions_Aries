## Unique Prime Multiplication

### Intro

<img src="img/unique_prime_factorization.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** states that every natural number greater than 11 can be written as a product of prime numbers.

In computing algorithm, it can be utilized to acquire the eigenvalue of a "string" regardless of the position of each "character". So, "abc" and "bca" could get the same eigenvalue via Unique Prime Multiplication.

### caveat

- the range of this eigenvalue might be larger than the max bound of the integer.
