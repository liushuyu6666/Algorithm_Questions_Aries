we need to find the first intersection node. we first form a Mobius band, then set lower pointer at 5 and upper pointer at 1. Walk forwards along the arrows, when upper pointer reach left 8, lower pointer must be at right 8, where they meet with each other. This is because the interval between lower pointer and upper pointer is fixed.
